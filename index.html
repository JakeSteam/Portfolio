					<p>Pixel Blacksmith is a free Android crafting game. It has been downloaded over 150,000 times, and has an average rating of 4.0.</p>
               <p>It was my first Android app, so has evolved significantly over time as my skills have improved, and in response to player feedback. The most recent iteration has a massive array of features, including 230+ items, 50+ traders, 50+ visitors, 20+ settings, and 25+ upgrades.</p>
					<p>Whilst working on the game, I've been the developer, designer, promoter, customer support, and any other role that has been required!</p>

					<p>Game Dev Algorithms is a Wordpress based blog updated a few times a month with algorithms / techniques I've come across whilst developing games, in the hope that they'll be useful to others.
					<p>
					<p>Techniques are explained fully, and contain diagrams and example code where appropriate.</p>
					<p>Most articles have code hosted on GitHub's <a href="https://gist.github.com/JakeSteam" target="_blank">Gist</a> platform.</p>

					<p>With over 10k installs, the Android game Connect Quest was a moderate success. It features a level generator, and a few rather complex algorithms for detecting puzzle completion.</p>
					<p>Additionally, puzzles can be shared between users &amp; imported via QR codes.</p>
					<p>It unfortunately ran into legal issues shortly after release, due to the word "Flow" in the original game name, leading to a rebrand.</p>

					<p>HealthGhost was a health blog created with a friend. The design was a heavily customised theme, modified to add various new features (such as post tags).</p>
					<p>Unfortunately it failed to gather much interest, so is no longer updated. It was previously hosted at HealthGhost.com, but is now retired to a free subdomain.</p>

				<h1>Skills</h1>
				<h3>Databases</h3>
				<p>I have a strong interest in order and structure, and databases perfectly fit that requirement. My MCSA and MTA were gained in my spare time due to my passion for databases, and I have extensive experience with most database flavours.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>MS SQL (T-SQL)</b> - Besides the two qualifications, I have also managed systems with 50+ remote SQLExpress instances, which often had to be repaired, updated, and analysed.</li>
					<li><b>MySQL</b> - I've maintained a 400GB+ MySQL instance, including regular backups &amp; restores, as well as hundreds of reports, data conversion exercises, and import tasks.</li>
					<li><b>SQLite</b> - Almost all of my Android apps use SQLite alongside various ORM libraries, and have required regular patches. Additionally, performance is crucial on mobile devices, so query optimisation was essential.</li>
					<li><b>Oracle SQL</b> - Whilst I don't have as much Oracle SQL experience as the other 3, I have worked on an extremely large and sprawling database for a company worth >&pound;20 billion.
				</ul>
				<h3>Languages</h3>
				<p>Like many programmers, most of my languages are self-taught, so have plenty of experience but no qualifications.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Java</b> - All my Android projects (personal & for my job) are written solely in Java. Additionally, I've managed Java projects across a variety of servers (Wildfly, Tomcat), most of which interacted with third piarty and internal APIs. </li>
					<li><b>C#</b> - I've written and maintained various C# programs for commercial use, some using WinForms, others to run as services.</li>
					<li><b>PHP</b> - One of the first languages I learned, I maintain and develop new features for a very large PHP intranet CMS that has been under constant development for over a decade.</li>
					<li><b>HTML, CSS, Javascript</b> - Whilst I prefer back-end languages and SQL, I have extensive experience with front-end languages and am comfortable using them to add functionality &amp; style.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Communities</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Reddit</b> - Due to my interest in Android, I've worked to become a moderator on various Android related subreddits. These include <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android" target="_blank">/r/Android</a> (750k users), <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidApps/" target="_blank">/r/AndroidApps</a> (100k), <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/" target="_blank">/r/AndroidGaming</a> (90k), and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/" target="_blank">/r/AndroidQuestions</a> (30k).<br>
						Moderating these requires collaboration with the other moderators (and Reddit's admin team), addressing user concerns, and coming up with initiatives to improve the subreddit. Rules and guidelines must also be enforced.
					</li>
					<li><b>Social Media</b> - To help promote my projects, I've used social media to let players get in touch. Pixel Blacksmith for example has active <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelBlacksmith/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PixelBlacksmith/" target="_blank">facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelBlacksmith" target="_blank">twitter</a> accounts.</li>
					<li><b>Gaming</b> - I've played various games over the years, usually in some type of community. In longer running games like MMORPGs, I've led teams of 50+ members for long periods of time and used ranks to delegate tasks to subleaders.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Other</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Software</b> - Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office Suite, industry standard FTP / Git / etc tools.</li>
					<li><b>Administration</b> - Experience managing Google Apps for Work, domain management, Windows Server.</li>
				</ul>
